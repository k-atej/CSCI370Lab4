Name of the Game:



Intent of the Game: 

This game was intended to simulate a carnival game. We wanted to recreate a classic carnival game, originally wanting to have the player throw darts at balloons. While the "darts" ultimately ended up as balls, the mechanics of the game remain the same.


Narrative Structure:




Mechanics:

The player navigates the scene with WASD & Space. The player can throw balls by clicking on the screen. Hitting a balloon will cause it to pop. Players begin with 30 darts and must reset the balloons in order to get more.



Aesthetics:

The game intends to preserve some level of realism, though there are some elements that aren't particularly realistic. This contrast matches the carnival theming, since carnivals are often associated with magic or the supernatural.



Joys & Struggles:

We found it pretty difficult to manage animations and the shader graphs. For the shader graphs in particular, the number of options was pretty overwhelming, so we ultimately went with more realistic shaders. 


Attributions:




Contributions:

Kate worked on the mechanics of the carnival game itself, including resetting the balloons and darts, and setting up the booth for the game to be played.
